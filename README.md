# easyback-express
A simple tool to easily create the basis of your backend in Express.js.

## The IDEA

The idea is to create a simple tool that allows you to create the basis of your backend in Express.js with just a few inputs.

The MVP consists of a simple frontent with forms to get the necessary information to create a .js file with the backend.

Later, the idea is to create a more complex tool that allows you to create a complete backend with database connection, authentication, etc.
Also following an architecture like MVC.


### About the project
I'm bored, and I want to learn doing something rather than watching endless courses countless times.

Also, I want to help the community as much as I can, so I thought that creating a simple tool like that could be useful for many people.

The project will be open source, and anyone can contribute to it.s

So, thanks for reading!
